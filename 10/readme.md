# Homework 10

### Task

Explore the concepts of hash functions and hash tables, and to implement a hash table with a custom hash function in JavaScript. This assignment will test your understanding of hash functions, collision resolution, and the practical application of hash tables.

### **Part 1: Understanding Hash Functions**

1. **Research**: Begin by researching and understanding what hash functions are, how they work, and their applications in computer science and data storage.

### **Part 2: Implementing a Custom Hash Function**

1. **Custom Hash Function**: Implement a custom hash function in JavaScript. Your hash function should take a string as input and produce a hash code (an integer) as output. Be creative, but ensure that your function distributes values uniformly.
2. **Collision Handling**: Implement a collision resolution strategy. You can choose from methods like separate chaining (using linked lists), open addressing (linear probing, quadratic probing), or any other technique you prefer.

### **Part 3: Building a Hash Table**

1. **Hash Table Class**: Create a JavaScript class for a hash table that uses your custom hash function. Include methods for inserting key-value pairs, retrieving values by key, and deleting key-value pairs.
2. **Testing**: Create test cases to ensure that your hash table and custom hash function work correctly. Test scenarios should include inserting, retrieving, and deleting values, as well as handling collisions gracefully.

### **Part 4: Documentation and Analysis**

1. **Documentation**: Provide clear and concise comments and documentation for your code. Explain how your custom hash function and hash table class work.
2. **Analysis**: Write a brief analysis of the performance of your custom hash function and hash table. Discuss the time complexity of key operations (insertion, retrieval, deletion) and any trade-offs you made in your implementation.

### **Submission**

Submit your JavaScript code for the custom hash function and hash table along with your documentation and analysis. Include test cases that demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of your implementation.

### **Example**

Here's a simplified example structure to give you an idea of what your code might look like:

```jsx
class CustomHashTable {
  constructor() {
    // Initialize the hash table...
  }

  hash(key) {
    // Implement your custom hash function...
  }

  insert(key, value) {
    // Implement key-value insertion...
  }

  get(key) {
    // Implement key retrieval...
  }

  delete(key) {
    // Implement key deletion...
  }
}

// Create an instance of CustomHashTable and demonstrate its usage...
```

### **Bonus Challenge**

For an extra challenge, consider implementing additional features for your hash table, such as resizing the table dynamically to maintain an efficient load factor, or implementing a method to iterate through all key-value pairs in the hash table.
